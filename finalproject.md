# Income Growth in South and Central America Relative to Aid by US and UK

I am looking at the growth of incomes in given South and Central American countries relative to the foreign aid from the US and UK they've received. I came into this believing
the US and UK would have relatively similar interests in terms of where their aid was going.

I am additionally looking at the income growth of their countries, and I believe that's important, as I'd expect every country giving aid to want to know that what they're giving
has a positive impact on the country they're giving it to.

1. Do the US and UK tend to give aid in the same places?
2. How does the aid the US and UK give relate to the financial growth of the countries they give to?

To get the charts, I used:

2004 Net bilateral aid flows from DAC donors, United States (current US$)
2004 Net bilateral aid flows from DAC donors, United Kingdom (current US$)
Annualized Mean Income Growth (2004-2009)

With a filter on the Latin America & Carribean region. I did this because most of the unfiltered data where I saw intersections was in that region, 
so it made sense to isolate it.

Overall, the data seems to suggest that the US and UK give aid *relatively* similarly, but not nearly as closely as I may have expected.

The interesting part of what I found, in my opinion, that more aid seemed to **decrease** the raw growth of a country. However, I think there could be a few explanations:

* Is more aid in dollar amounts given to countries that have started to need larger amounts to be successful?
* Is more aid in dollar amounts given to larger countries, that would need a larger proportion to see similar results?
* Country sample size is low, so it seems plausible that difficulties specific to individual countries could skew results
* "Aid" may be building towards financial growth, but not necessarily showing itself immediately, as it could be solving problems that set the country up for future success

Or even, plausibly, some combination of the above.
